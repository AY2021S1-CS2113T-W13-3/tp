## Design & Implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

![ArchitectureDiagram](diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The **Architecture Design** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Duke`** is the main class of the application, and handles the app launch, initializing the appropriate classes to be used.

The rest of the app consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.

### UI component

The `Ui` component

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed in `Duke`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. In addition, the `Ui` may also perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

### Model component

The `Model`,

* stores a current `Template` object that represents the current circuit configuration.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
