## 1. How To Use This Guide

This **User Guide** aims to help you get familiarised with the commands used in the *Command Line Interface* (CLI) application. The following table indicates the symbols used to aid the understanding of the guide. The end of this **User Guide** also gives a [summary of commands](#9-command-summary) used in the application.

| Symbol/Format | Meaning |
|:---------------:|:--------|
|:information_source:|An informational source.|
|:exclamation:|A warning.|
|:bulb:|A tip.|
|**Bolded**|A keyword.|
|*Italicised*|Technical word.|
|[Hyperlinked](#)|Leads to the appropriate section.|
|`Code`|Text that appears on the CLI / in code.|

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Introduction

**CLIrcuit Assistant** is a desktop app to implement and solve simple **circuits** and **logic gate configurations**, optimized for use via the *CLI*. The application is targeted at those who would simply like a resource-light and offline program to aid in analysing circuits. 

At its current implementation, this application has no storage feature. More information on this can be found in the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md#storage-wira).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Note:**  This application has no storage feature.

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Quick Start

The following section will explain the steps taken to get **CLIrcuit Assistant** running on your computer.

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
1. Download the latest version of `Duke` from [the releases](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W13-3/tp/releases).
1. Double click the `jar` file to start the application. 
    1. If the above step does not open the app, then open your *terminal* and make sure you are in the folder with the `jar` file. 
    1. Type the following command: 
        ```
        java -jar duke.jar
        ```
1. Once the app starts, type a command in the command line and press enter to execute it.
1. Use the command `tutorial circuit` or `tutorial boolean` to go through an [interactive tutorial](#52-interactive-tutorial) before using the application.
1. Alternatively, you can use the command [`summary`](#51-summary-of-commands-) to get a list of all commands used in the application.
1. Note that a *logging* file `appLog.log` will be created in the same directory that `duke.jar` is run from. For further information regarding *logging*, you can refer to the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Command Preface

![Command](diagrams/CommandUserDiagram.png)

The diagram above shows the hierarchy of the types of commands in the application. [If you are looking for the summary of commands, it can be found at the end of this guide](#9-command-summary). In this **User Guide**, you can find the following sections listed below:

* [General Commands](#5-general-commands)
* [Circuit Action Commands](#6-circuit-action-commands)
* [Boolean Action Commands](#7-boolean-action-commands)

Action commands are split into **two categories** - they may use the same *syntax* for some commands, but the application will continuously track the current `template` that is being worked on and automatically use the correct command to execute. Thus, if there is no current `template`, then the other commands used will not be available to run.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Note:** The `template` command is essential.

</div>

The commands involved with both categories are:

* `tutorial`
* `template`
* `set`
* `add`
* `calc`

The format of commands below keep to the following.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Note:**  Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Note:**  Given a command parsed to require *n* arguments, any argument after the *n*th argument will be ignored.

</div>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Circuit Action Commands 

This section details how the commands are used with a **circuit template**. You can use this section to build simple template circuits which may have *resistors*, *capacitors*, or *inductors*. It may be important to note that the circuit diagrams shown in the expected outputs are simplified circuits, even when adding components. For example, adding a resistor in parallel to a template that contains a resistor will change the effective resistance in the circuit, but it will not update the diagram to show a second resistor.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Note:**  With the limited time and GUI constraints, there is no dynamic visualisation update for the circuits.

</div>

### 6.1 Creating a circuit template <a name="template-circ"></a>

This command creates a circuit template. This command must be used to be able to use the `set`, `add`, `calc` commands since those commands must be done on an existing `template`.

| Command Format | 
|:-:|
|`template TEMPLATE`|

* The `TEMPLATE` can be chosen from the following 4:
    * `r` only consists of the resistor.
    * `rc` consists of the resistor and capacitor.
    * `rl` consists of the resistor and inductor.
    * `lc` consists of the inductor and capacitor.

Example of usage:

`template rc`

Expected outcome:

```
	+---R-----C---+
	|             |
	|             |
	+----+V_ac+---+
Current Voltage: 0.0 V
Total Resistance: 0.0 Ω
Total Capacitance: 0.0 µF
```

### 6.2 Setting a component value <a name='set-comp'></a>

This command sets the value of a component. The component must be part of the current circuit template. Units correspond to the component involved - *resistors* in *ohms*, *capacitors* in *microfarads*, and *inductors* in *microhenries*. The values would need to be set to perform calculations or analysis such as in the [`calc`](#64-calculating-effective-value-) command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Warning:** You cannot set a component not present in the current working template.

</div>

| Command Format | 
|:-:|
|`set COMPONENT VALUE`|

* The `COMPONENT` can be chosen from the following 4, but only if they are part of the template:
    * `r` represents a resistor
    * `c` represents a capacitor
    * `l` represents an inductor
    * `v` represents a voltage source
* The `VALUE` can be an integer of a float, of which the units depends on the component set.

Example of usage:

`set r 500`

Expected Outcome:
```
The resistor was set to 500.0 Ω
	+---R-----C---+
	|             |
	|             |
	+----+V_ac+---+
Current Voltage: 0.0 V
Total Resistance: 500.0 Ω
Total Capacitance: 0.0 µF
```

### 6.3 Adding a component <a name="add-comp"></a>

This command adds a component, in a specific configuration - either *in parallel* or *in series* - to the current circuit template. This allows you to quickly obtain calculations to your chosen configurations. Only *load components* can be added - you cannot add a *voltage source*. You should only add a component after it has already been set.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-tip">

:bulb: **Tip:**  You can add components as long as there is already a value set using the `set` command.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Warning:** You cannot add a component not present in the current working template.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Warning:** You cannot add a new *voltage source* `v` to any template.

</div>

| Command Format | 
|:-:|
|`add CONFIG COMPONENT VALUE`|

* The `CONFIG` can be chosen from the 2 - `series` and `parallel`.
* The `COMPONENT` and `VALUE` are as explained above under [Set component value](#62-setting-a-component-value-), except that `COMPONENT` cannot be the voltage source `v`.

Example of usage:

`add parallel r 500`

Expected Outcome:

```
Nice, added a 500.0 Ω
	+---R-----C---+
	|             |
	|             |
	+----+V_ac+---+
Current Voltage: 0.0 V
Total Resistance: 250.0 Ω
Total Capacitance: 0.0 µF
```

### 6.4 Calculating effective value <a name="calc-circ"></a>

This command calculates the various effective values based on the `template` configuration. If calculating `reff`, `ceff`, or `leff`, the component must be part of the current circuit template. You can obtain the various values detailed below quickly after setting the necessary components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Warning:** You cannot calculate the value of a component not present in the current working template.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Note:**  If a component is not yet set, its effective value, as well as the *current* and *power* flowing through the power supply, will default to 0.

</div>

| Command Format | 
|:-:|
|`calc EFF_VALUE`|

* The `EFF_VALUE` can be chosen from the following 5:
    * `reff` is the effective resistance
    * `ceff` is the effective capacitance
    * `leff` is the effective inductance
    * `current` is the current flowing through the power supply
    * `power` is the power supplied by the power supply

Example of usage:

`calc reff`

Expected Outcome:

```
The effective resistance calculated is 250.0 Ω
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Boolean Action Commands

This section details how the commands are used with a **boolean template**. You can use this section to build simple logic circuits which may be made up of various gates such as `AND`, `OR`, and `XOR` gates.

### 7.1 Creating a boolean template <a name='template-logic'></a>

This command creates a boolean template. Similar to the [circuit template](#6-circuit-action-commands), this command must be used to be able to use the `set`, `add`, `calc` commands since those commands must be done on an existing `template`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Note:**  In all expected outcomes, `?` denotes an input that is not yet set.

</div>

| Command Format | 
|:-:|
|`template GATE`|

* Logic Gate `GATE` can be chosen from the following:
    * `and`, `or`, `xor`, `nand`, `nor`, `xnor`

Example of usage:

`template and`

Expected outcome:

```
      OUT
       |
   B       C

OUT = B AND C
B = ?
C = ?
```
Here, `OUT` represents the output of the boolean template. The letters `B` and `C` can correspond to `INPUT` which is used in the following section. `?` represents an `INPUT` which is not yet set.

### 7.2 Setting an input value <a name='set-input'></a>

This command sets the value of an input. The inputs will then be used in the `calc` command to give the output of the boolean template. The input must not have already been set as a `Gate` and must be part of the diagram.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Warning:** The `INPUT` must exist in the diagram, and must not have already been set as a `GATE`.

</div>

| Command Format | 
|:-:|
|`set INPUT VALUE`|

* The `INPUT` can be chosen only from the current `template`.
* The `VALUE` can be any integer, but any non-zero integer will be treated as `1`, while 0 is treated as `0`.

Example of usage:

`set B 0`

Expected Outcome:
```
      OUT
       |
   B       C

OUT = B AND C
B = 0
C = ?
```

### 7.3 Adding a Gate <a name="add-gate"></a>

The application has the ability to combine multiple `Gate` objects to generate more complicated boolean logic gate configurations. This command allows you to set an input to a boolean logic `Gate`. You can also change an existing gate if needed. However, the depth of the deepest logic `Gate` from the *root* logic `Gate` (at the top) cannot exceed 2.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-tip">

:bulb: **Tip:**  You can use this command to change an existing `Gate`.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Warning:** The `Gate` depth cannot exceed 2.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Note:**  The current implementation only allows the `Gate` objects to be 3 levels deep, counting from 0 at the top.

</div>

| Command Format | 
|:-:|
|`add INPUT GATE`|

* The `INPUT` is as explained above in [Set](#72-setting-an-input-value-).
* The `GATE` is as explained above in [Template](#71-creating-a-boolean-template-).

Example of usage:

`add C or`

Expected Outcome:

```
      OUT
       |
   B       C
         F   G

OUT = B AND C
B = 0
C = F OR G
F = ?
G = ?
```

### 7.4 Calculating output <a name="calc-output"></a>

This command calculates the output of the configured logic gates, and requires that all inputs of the circuit are set. The output is represented by `OUT` in the printed `template`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Warning:** The output cannot be calculated if any input is not set yet.

</div>

| Command Format | 
|:-:|
|`calc`|

Example of usage:

`calc`

Expected Outcome:

```
      OUT
       |
   B       C
         F   G

OUT = B AND C
B = 0
C = F OR G
F = 1
G = 0

The output of the above configuration is 0.
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. FAQ

This section details the **frequently asked questions (FAQ)** regarding the use of the application.

**Q**: How do I know the difference between the components?

**A**: Pay attention in CG1111 Engineering Principles & Practice (EPP).

**Q**: How do I know what each logic gate does?

**A**: Pay attention in EE2026 Digital Design.

**Q**: Why is the interactive tutorial so restrictive?
