Hello struggling CG1111 student
You have entered Tutorial Mode!
Type 'exit' if you want to leave this mode and go back to the application.
Lets get started! First choose a template you want to work with.You can choose from rc, rl, lc and r templates.
eg. To select the Resistor-Capacitor circuit template, enter 'template rc.'
Current Voltage: 0.0 V
	+---R-----C---+
	|             |
	|             |
	+----+V_ac+---+
Total Resistance: 0.0 Ω
Total Capacitance: 0.0 µF

Lets set a value to our power source! Type in 'set v VALUE' , where VALUE is a +ve number in volts.
The voltage source was changed to: 5.0 V
Lets set a value to resistor/capacitor/inductor! To do so, type 'set' followed by 'r' OR 'c' OR 'l' followed by a numeric VALUE. eg. 'set r 500' will set the resistor to 500Ω
The resistor was set to 500.0 Ω
Current Voltage: 5.0 V
	+---R-----C---+
	|             |
	|             |
	+----+V_ac+---+
Total Resistance: 500.0 Ω
Total Capacitance: 0.0 µF

Lets set another value in our template! Here's the syntax for reference 'set r/l/c/v VALUE'.
The capacitor was set to 20.0 µF
Current Voltage: 5.0 V
	+---R-----C---+
	|             |
	|             |
	+----+V_ac+---+
Total Resistance: 500.0 Ω
Total Capacitance: 20.0 µF

Want to add a component in parallel/series to your current component? Lets do that! Type in 'add' followed by 'series/parallel' then 'r'/'c'/'l' and a numeric VALUE.
eg. 'add parallel c 500' will add a capacitor in parallel to the capacitor in your circuit (if any).
Nice, added a 40.0 µF
Current Voltage: 5.0 V
	+---R-----C---+
	|             |
	|             |
	+----+V_ac+---+
Total Resistance: 500.0 Ω
Total Capacitance: 40.0 µF

Great! Say, do you think we could find effective power/current consumed by the circuit?Or even effective resistance/inductance/capacitance? Yes!
Lets try it out. Type 'calc' followed by 'ceff'/'leff'/'reff'/'power'/'current' and enter. :D
The power dissipated in the circuit is 0.04937852460756959W
Great! You're set to use
